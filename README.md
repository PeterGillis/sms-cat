<h3>Description</h3>

<p>We identified a need for a user to avoid disclosing their phone number to unstrausted parties. For example when calling your Food Delivery Driver to help or the person you are picking up an ebay item from to help locate each other.

We realised that we had identified a purpose for an app to make a phone call or send an SMS to another party without revealing the actual phone number of the user, but instead showing an alias number.

In Germany especially, there are many privacy issues in line with GDPR and many users who wish to keep their personal Data safe. We wanted to fulfill this need, we present to you 6789Cat!
